# Nathaniel-Team-Profile-Generator
## Description
#
A series of questions through prompts allows the user to create profiles for their various team members.

## Installation 
#
This generator was created using node.js and npm installations such as inquirer and jest. Bootstrap and jquery frameworks were used as well.

## Usage
#
Module exports are used from various files in order for the index.js to be called upon in the terminal. This where the user answers the questions in order to generate the index.html. The user also uses 'npm test' in the terminal to run the tests of the application's functionality. 
## Credits
#
Credit goes to UCI for providing an outline on how to organize all of the folders and files.
